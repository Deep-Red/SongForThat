# SongForThat

## Search

From the main page, type the title or artist of a song, or the name of a tag you are interested in.

Results will populate as you type.

## Tags

When you select a tag, a list of songs that have been tagged with that term will be displayed.

## Songs

When you select a song, you will find a page displaying the title and artist for that song, any associated tags, and an option to add a new tag to the song.

### Voting on tags

To vote on a tag simply click the green check-mark or the red cross to indicate whether the tag is appropriate for that song. This could mean that a song is about the term, or that it would be appropriate at an event described by the term, or even that the term properly describes the tone of the song. Appropriateness is fairly subjective here, and in general should be viewed fairly leniently, but simply mentioning a concept in an otherwise unrelated song is probably not enough to qualify.
Tags that have been upvoted more for a song will be displayed first, so over time the first few tags should be the most apt.

### Adding tags

After clicking the 'Add a new Tag' button a search box will appear. Begin typing your term. If the tag already exists you can simply click the 'Tag Song' button under it to add that tag to the song. Otherwise, click 'Create Tag' and the tag will now be available to click the 'Tag Song' button, here and on other songs as well.
